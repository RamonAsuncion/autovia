- Dataset you'd like to use: url, what's in it.


- Any initial example notebook/github/medium article whatever that does what you're going to explain. 


- What have you learned about what you're trying to do.


- If you're using ACET 116 resources (the larger GPU cards that may be necessary to train a deep neural network), does our environment have what you need? Our environment has pytorch for gpu-based training, but if you think you need tensorflow, it may be possible as well.
